													<h1>Challenge</h1>
													<br>
													<br>

						         		   <p>As a new designer joining a team, I was giving a new challenge for this week. By analyzing an already existing and highly adopted app and incorporate a new feature into the existing product. The feature I develop will be based on an area of functionality to be explored and compared to user input. </p>
													 <p> The app I chose was Waze, since its the worlds largest community-based traffic and navigation app. With 110 million monthly users in 185 countries. If you think that blows your mind? Wait till you read this: Google bought them for 1.3 billion dollars in 2013 and ended up implementing many of Waze coolest features into Google Maps. Thats amazing!</p>

<hr class="col-md-24 col-sm-24" style="">

													<h1>Who's Out There</h1>
													<br>
													<br>

													<p>So in order to incorporate a new feature into Waze. I needed to understand the users needs and what challenges they were facing with the current app. Since this is a exciting and healthy adopted app I conducted secondary research where we would analyzed the context of the business. By creating a business analysis on who’s out there who are the competitors in the current market today. Since, Google bought Waze I excluded Google Maps from my competitive analysis. I learned that Waze and MapQuest had several disadvantage with Apple Maps. They only offer the platform for cars as well as not offering offline navigation. Although I still needed to research the users. I knew that these were minor features that I would implement into the app.</p>

													<h1>Understanding the problem</h1>
													<br>
													<br>

													<p>In order to dive into the users I went out there and implement a user “Guerrilla-Style” research where I interviewed users who have used or recently used Waze. I collected their pains and gains and created a Value Proposition Canvas to understand what jobs Waze is able to hold. From my users pains and gains I implemented pain relievers and gain creators to really create an ultimate app for our users.</p>

													<h1>What are the opportunities?</h1>
													<br>
													<br>

													<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
													<p>Based on my results I outlined what is and what isn’t for a job-to-be-done. When focuses on the situation, the want focus on the motivation, and the can focuses on the outcome. Job stories focus on all four layers of design: outcome, structure, interaction and visual. In order to really take Waze into a whole new level where they could beat the market, I implemented all transportation methods into the app: cars, trucks (for truck zone routes), motorcycle, walking and electronic scooters.</p>

													<p>Electric scooters are taking over the cities. Exploding popularity of Bird, Lime, Skip, Spin and Scoot. They’re all electric scooter-rental services which allows riders to locate and unlock scooters with an app. When they reach their destination, they just walk away. E-scooters have little to no restriction, you could go through alternative routes that are not necessarily streets or sidewalks, providing a more freedom route to your destination.</p>

													<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
													<h1>Prototyping with different fidelity</h1>
													<br>

													<br>
													<p>I mapped out a User Flow Chart. Where it shows the path or paths a user takes to complete a task. The primary goal here is to see how users will interact with the new feature.
														Based on my user flow chart I was then able to create my Lo-Fi Wireframes. Creating a Usability Test Report Quantitative and Qualitative where I can see how quickly our users can perform the task as well as how many errors do the user make. In order to move the design process foward I made the following changes:</p>
														<p> - Add the Home/Map screen </p>
														<p> - Create two paths to go to the search engine screen </p>
														<p> - Include a keyboard </p>
														<p> - Modify some icons</p>
														<p> - Highlight which icon they’re selecting</p>
													<p> Based on those changes, I moved forward and created my Mid-Fi Wireframes. Also creating a Usability Test Report Quantitative in order to see if users are still having issues in completing the mission. Based on the data you can see that users misclick rate was cut into half as well as reducing the average duration in completing the task to 7 seconds. Although the average success went from 100% to 71.4% this is beacuse some users completed the mission via another path than the expected one.</p>
<br>

													<h1>Final Design</h1>
													<br>
													<br>

													<p>In order to move foward I had to do a visual design documantion of the existing app, Atomic Design Inventory. Creating all symbols, buttons, icons, colors, typefaces from the app. Since Waze is an exisiting app there are rules and guides that I had to follow in order to build my Hi-fi Prototype. Check out the final prototype below:

																				 </ul>

													<h1>Takeaways</h1>
													<br>
													<br>
													<p>Even though I got this assignment done in four days I still feel there is always more for improvement. In order for this feature to become successfull we will need to create an algorithm that will actually capture alternative routes that are not streets or sidewalks. Also, the app needs to fix some of the current bugs they’re facing as well as implement new features such as: Traffic Cameras Alerts, Police Heat Maps, Lane Guidance, Drive Summary.
														Imagine if Waze joins forces with an electric scooter-rental company? They would be indestructible!!</p>
